Hi 👋 My name is Rafael Simionato
=================================

Senior Product Engineer | SaaS Platform Architect | Founder of Looplijn

I build production-grade web platforms focused on performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

Looplijn is a live product and represents how I design and evolve complete systems end to end, from frontend architecture to backend services, data modeling, deployment workflows, and access control.

## What I Build

At Looplijn, I design and develop modern platforms that include:

- Content-driven websites and dashboards
- Access control and multi-user systems
- Payments and subscription-ready architectures
- High-performance frontend with strong UX standards
- Secure backend services with PostgreSQL and row-level security
- Deployment pipelines and CI/CD workflows on Vercel

Everything is built in pure code with modern stacks and production standards.
