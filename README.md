# Hi 👋 I’m Rafael Simionato  
AI Product Engineer | LLM-Powered SaaS Builder | Founder of Looplijn  

I build AI-powered web platforms end to end, from frontend architecture to backend systems, data modeling, automation workflows, and LLM integrations.

I focus on creating production-grade products that eliminate repetitive work through intelligent automation.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

I’m the founder of Looplijn, a live AI-powered SaaS platform where I:

- Design and implement LLM-powered assistants and AI workflows  
- Experiment with prompt engineering to ship features that feel seamless  
- Build secure multi-tenant dashboards with row-level data protection  
- Structure scalable architectures ready for analytics, subscriptions, and automation  

Looplijn represents how I design and evolve complete systems in real production environments.
